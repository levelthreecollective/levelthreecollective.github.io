Q: Who is Zano? What do we need to know? If there was one thing you wanted to tell people about yourself, what would it be? 

So many parts of me make me who I am. The first thing is where I'm from. Being from Johannesburg is very important to my identity; it's something I carry with me every day. Not in a way where it's, 'Oh, I'm South African, look at me and my flag on my bedroom door,' but more so in the way I speak to people, how I share my energy, and how there's a level of kindness that South Africans carry with them. That’s expressed a lot in the music I play, how I play it, and how I ensure that when I DJ, I share my energy with the people around me. That's important because when people come into spaces that are very foreign to them, or if they've been to these spaces hundreds of times, it either becomes repetitive or feels like home. So I need to respect those different energies in the room and cater to them while still being, you know, true to myself.

When it comes to other things, I am currently getting my master's in finance, which is something a lot of people don't know. I chose this path because I've always wanted to work in finance, partly to check off a box in my life and be able to say I can do anything and everything. On the other hand, my best friend Fatima and I started a creative studio and production house, which has been up and running for the last two months. So, my life is filled with many things, and many people only know what I share on Instagram.

Q: What was it like growing up in Johannesburg? I know you went to college in the U.S., so maybe we could start by talking about your high school years.

Growing up in Johannesburg was beautiful but challenging. I think it's because we're a young democracy with a separatist history. We were ushered into this new society 30 years ago, built primarily on love—not by ignoring color, but by seeing people for who they are, not the color of their skin. This idea that we're all one and that this is our nation felt like it covered up the cracks of what South Africa truly is. It's difficult when you come from such a fractured past, and the present has been turned into a fairytale without addressing the hurt and pain that people have experienced. This definitely affected my high school experience.

It was beautiful to be in classrooms taught by the best teachers and surrounded by brilliant, intellectual students, but I believe issues of race affected my high school experience. When you're young, you don't fully understand it because we were placed in a society where such topics weren't openly discussed. So when issues of race surfaced, I would question myself: 'Are they reacting this way because of my skin color, or did I do something wrong?' It took me many years to overcome that mentality, partly because I attended a British boarding school where colonial attitudes influenced the institution. Add racism on top of that, and it's a chaotic situation.

Q: When you come to a place like New York, race becomes relevant in your daily life. How did your past experiences in Johannesburg shape your perspective as you grew up in the city?

I think New York is different because racism is very class-based and is often determined by how you speak, dress, act, and where you live. While my experience in South Africa was deeply systemic, the essence of South Africans is kindness, giving people the time to be heard, and actively participating in conversations. These values helped me here. However, I found it challenging to navigate race in New York because, in South Africa, especially in Johannesburg, many spaces are filled with Black people, so you never feel like the 'other.' You feel like you belong, and no one makes you feel out of place. In New York, it's the complete opposite. In many spaces, you are treated as the 'other,' and people don't give you the opportunity to feel like you belong.

Q: Taking a step back, how did you decide on New York as your landing spot?

You know, it's exciting. When I went back home in December, I was going through my old journals and diaries. In one of the diaries, written when I was nine years old, there was a question asking about my dream destination. I wrote 'New York City.' I didn’t even realize back then that this was something I wanted. After graduating from university, I felt that the next step where I could challenge myself to the fullest was to come to New York.

"Those intimate moments with my mother and father ... made me place music at the center of my life."

I didn't come here to chase a dream or pursue a passion but rather to push myself to the limits of who I am. What are my values? What are my morals? I wanted to test myself because the city certainly does that to you. My love for music and being around people who were unapologetically themselves allowed me to pursue this side of me where I could share my passion for music with others. I hadn't expected that sharing my love for music would be a byproduct of my decision to move to New York.

Q: Looking at things now, what role would you say music plays in your life?

Honestly, it's the central role in my life. My relationship with music began when I was very young, thanks to my father, who introduced me to a diverse range of music. He was a freedom fighter during apartheid and, while imprisoned with Nelson Mandela, they would all listen to the radio. He discovered The Beatles, Guns N' Roses, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder while in the cells.

After he grew up and had children, he introduced us to that music. When he drove us to school, he would blast music daily. Those intimate moments with my mother and father — who introduced me to George Michael, Stevie Wonder, and Aretha Franklin, all iconic and soulful musicians — made me place music at the center of my life. It has always been a part of me, not in a cliché way, but truly since I was very young.

Q: Let's talk about Intima Studios. Who is Fatima? How did you two meet, and how did the studio come to fruition?

Intima emerged from our need to place our experiences and perspectives at the center of the conversation and reclaim that power.

Fatima and I met three and a half years ago. I moved to New York because my best friend Tenzing, whom I met in college, asked me if I wanted to move there. I ended up living with her best friend in Bushwick. I first met Fatima at my apartment, when Tenzing had invited everyone over. Fatima came up to me and said, 'Oh my God, you're Zano,' and asked if I could help her get ready. From that moment, we shared this energy, as if we'd known each other for years. We clicked right away.

The idea behind Intima came from realizing that we're at a point in our careers and lives where we've gathered all this knowledge through our experiences—me through Koza, moving here, and DJ'ing, and Fatima through her work in high fashion. We recognized that many people around us are talented and passionate about their creative crafts, but they don't have a team to help package and sell their work to an agency, big publication, or brand. So, we wanted to act as an intermediary force, collaborating on projects with various directors, stylists, and makeup artists. We focus on the project, organize it, keep it crisp and chic, and sell it to the major companies.

Another core value is ensuring that the narratives, stories, and perspectives of our community are at the forefront. It's easy for these perspectives to go unappreciated or mishandled. Intima emerged from our need to put our experiences and perspectives at the center of the conversation and reclaim that power.

Q: Is there anything we can look forward to? What's coming up?

There are actually a lot of things coming up with Intima that I can share. We have a music video launching in the next few months with the artist Keith Charles. We've also got a few shoots in the pipeline that I believe will make a significant impact.

Q: With the exposure you've had, from back home to DJing and now with Intima, who are some of your favorite creatives or brands? What are you keeping an eye on?

Since Intima is rooted in my South African background and Fatima's Lebanese heritage while living in New York, the city serves as a focal point. We incorporate South Africa and Lebanon into everything we do.

One brand I'm closely watching is Wanda Lephoto, an incredible South African brand. A photographer I'm following is Jack Markovitz, a documentary photographer who's making waves. I always try to keep things as local as possible because that's what grounds me. Whenever I go home, I keep an eye on the local scene because South Africa is buzzing with creativity.

People may not always connect with it because it's so far away, but I do my best to bridge those worlds, and I know Fatima does as well.

Q: It seems like you keep yourself busy. What does relaxation mean to you, or, better yet, what does it look like?

The ideal day for me would start by getting up at nine, getting dressed, and heading to SoulCycle at 9:30. Then, after coming home and showering, I'd get a matcha or take a stroll with music to center myself, followed by enjoying a solo meal and romanticizing my life a bit.

Ideally, I'd go back home, watch a movie or my favorite series, then meet up with friends for dinner. We'd have a little too much wine, maybe some tequila shots, and who knows? We might go out afterward or just head home.

To me, that's relaxation, because the idea of relaxation and self-care is often seen as extreme—like booking a trip to an island and sitting on the beach. While that's an ideal form of relaxation, I believe that if you can incorporate it into your everyday routine, it becomes about finding moments of stillness throughout it all.

Q: On that note, what series or movies are you watching right now?

Series-wise, things have been quite stale. I know there are a lot of good shows, but I haven't felt the urge to watch anything new. I've been rewatching Nathan For You and Gossip Girl, and revisiting Gossip Girl has been especially grounding for me.

Q: You've talked a lot about home and the importance of appreciating life and those around you—from how you met Fatima to how love is a centerpiece. What would you say draws you to the people you're closest to today?

The people I'm closest to today all share a part of themselves that is very selfless and firmly rooted in their identity. When you're grounded in your own identity, belonging, and values, it becomes something I naturally gravitate towards because it's tough to find people who have clear values, stand by them, and can confidently say, 'This is what I believe in.' When you meet others who share those values, it's easy to connect and vibe.

With Level Three, it's similar—where you and Dennis are firmly grounded in what you want this to be and in your sense of self. You don't enter spaces trying to cosplay a different persona but instead create spaces for yourselves and simply show up as your authentic selves, which is rare.

Q: What do you believe is the most important aspect of uplifting women who DJ? Outside of this interview, you previously mentioned your appreciation for Bossa Nova and its role in providing safe spaces for women DJs.

As a woman DJ, I've been fortunate not to have faced physical harassment, but I've experienced smaller, very disrespectful incidents. I remember once when I was DJing, a guy in the crowd approached me and asked, 'Yo, yo, can I plug in?' I said no, but he still offered $200 and handed me his USB, asking if he could plug it in.

There was no one around to act as a buffer and tell him that he couldn't do that. It's not on women to always have male friends around to make them feel safe. Everyone has their own life. It's up to the venue and party organizers to ensure that women DJs feel protected. Confidence can only go so far as a buffer, but physicality and egos can surpass that.

"You walk with love, act with love, talk with love, and share love."

That's why I chose Bossa Nova; it's a place where I feel the safest when DJing. If I feel harassed, I can inform someone, and they'll remove that person. However, many times in other venues, no one has taken action. It's crucial for women to choose venues that support them. I understand it's challenging if you're a full-time DJ relying on your work for income, but where possible, women should focus on collective-based parties where they know the people involved rather than at random parties. This way, they can build relationships with those who will have their backs.

Q: On that note, who are your favorite women DJs in the city right now? It's a good opportunity for you to give a shout-out.

I really enjoy Lovie World; she's a cool house DJ and a Black woman! I also love Las Flaquitas, a group of three women doing their thing. I have to celebrate that and be a part of it. I really like Dylan Ali as well; she's doing her thing too.

These three women each have distinct styles: Lovie World is house-based, Las Flaquitas lean towards dancehall, and Dylan is more of a hip-hop DJ. These women are excelling in male-dominated genres, which is challenging, but being at the top of their game is a privilege they've all earned.

Q: What do you live by? Is there any quote, motto, or advice that you keep close to your heart?
You walk with love, act with love, talk with love, and share love.

When I do a DJ set, one thing my mom told me is to walk with love, act with love, talk with love, and share love. Keep these four things in mind when you're in a space. Whatever happens is already yours, and whatever isn't yours was never meant to be. So, don't hold on to any ideas—just let them flow. Everything worthy will come to you.

Q: When it's all said and done, whether you return to Johannesburg or simply step away from the scene, what do you want Zano to be remembered for or as?

I just want to be remembered as someone who made others feel seen. That's really it. Social capital is great, and having people who want you in their space is also great. Being afforded the privilege of being in these spaces is amazing, but ultimately, I want to be remembered for making people feel seen. I want people to say, 'Oh, yeah, I remember Zano. When I saw her or spoke with her, she made me feel seen.' That's it. Everything else is just an added bonus to this experience of living, honestly.
