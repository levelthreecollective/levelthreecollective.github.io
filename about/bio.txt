“We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.” - Confucius. 

Level III is built on the foundation of transition -- a word that resonates across our teams’ lives, all of whom have found themselves on paths at odds with their dreams and in need of shifting their ways of life. The first life we are born into, the second life we realize a change needs to happen, and the third life is Level Three: where you are finally who you want to be. Our transitional phases have led us to ask each other, “Who do you want to be?” and we hope that everyone who engages with Level III feels supported to find their answer to that question in our community. 

Our Level III Radio / Events / Editorial platforms allow us to express our admiration of music and the broader creative ecosystem. As you interact with us, take something and give something as well.

Remember to ask yourself, Who do you want to be?
